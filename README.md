# A New Way to Understand Your Skin

Most acne advice is generic.
Avoid dairy. Sleep more. Drink water. Reduce stress.

But your skin isn’t generic.

This app is built on a simple belief:
Health is personal, and advice should be too.

Instead of telling you what usually causes breakouts, we help you discover what affects your skin — using your own data as evidence.

We connect the dots between your daily life and your breakouts:

How your sleep patterns show up on your skin

How certain foods correlate with flare-ups

How stress, hydration, and habits interact over time

Not guesses. Not trends. Not influencer advice.
Just patterns drawn from your lived experience.

Think of it as navigation for your health.
You log. We analyze. You learn. You adjust.

Small insights. Better decisions. Fewer surprises.

Because the goal isn’t perfection.
It’s awareness, clarity, and control.

Your skin is a system.
Let’s understand it — together.
